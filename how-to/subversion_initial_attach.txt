Post install shit...
1) Create svn user and svn group.
2) Add www user to svn group (svn group should have svn, www as users).
3) Create repo (as below) but make sure owner is svn:svn so Apache can serve it.
4) if svn info shows that ssh+svn was used, add the UNIX user (travis) to the svn group.

--- Now, let's use subversion!

1) Create the svn repository
	% svnadmin create /usr/local/svnrepo/unix_scripts

2) Create standard dirs
	% svn mkdir file:///usr/local/svnrepo/unix_scripts/trunk
	% svn mkdir file:///usr/local/svnrepo/unix_scripts/tags
	% svn mkdir file:///usr/local/svnrepo/unix_scripts/branches
	% svn mkdir file:///usr/local/svnrepo/unix_scripts/docs

At this point we have our repo setup.  Now, our goal is to put an existing file structure in svn control.

3) Checkout the repo (Either the whole deal or just the dirs we want to add stuff to)
	% svn checkout file:///usr/local/svnrepo/unix_scripts
	% svn checkout file:///usr/local/svnrepo/unix_scripts/trunk

4) Put stuff in dirs

5) Now, let's add the stuff
	% cd /path/to/the/repo/you/checkedout (where you just copied your files)
	% svn add *
	% svn commit --message "Your Message"
That's it!
