Sometimes you want to search for a pattern and add some characters, like parenthesis,
around or near the pattern you found. It is easy to do this if you are looking for a particular string:

sed 's/abc/(abc)/' <old >new

This won't work if you don't know exactly what you will find. How can you put the string you found in
the replacement string if you don't know what it is?

The solution requires the special character "&." It corresponds to the pattern found.

sed 's/[a-z]*/(&)/' <old >new

You can have any number of "&" in the replacement string. You could also double a pattern, e.g. the first number of a line:

% echo "123 abc" | sed 's/[0-9]*/& &/'
123 123 abc
