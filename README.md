Deprecated: migrated `$HOME` thing back to a mono repo.  See [dotfiles](https://github.com/tmeisenh/dotfiles).

My $HOME.  Probably of no use to anyone else.

I started out in GNU/Linux but migrated to FreeBSD years ago.  That explains why my defaults are for FreeBSD with dependencies on GNU core-utils.

$ ./install.sh
$ (cd vim; git submodule update --init --recursive; ./install.sh)
$ (cd zsh; ./install.sh)
