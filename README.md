home
========
My $HOME.  Probably of no use to anyone else.

I started out in GNU/Linux but migrated to FreeBSD years ago.  That explains why my defaults are for FreeBSD with dependencies on GNU core-utils.

$ ./install.sh
$ (cd vim; git submodule update --init --recursive; ./install.sh)
$ (cd zsh; ./install.sh)
